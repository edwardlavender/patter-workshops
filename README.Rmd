[![Project Status: Active -- The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

^\*^This repository is maintained by Edward Lavender (edward.lavender@eawag.ch).

# Introduction

This repository contains [`patter`](https://github.com/edwardlavender/patter) workshop materials. [`patter`](https://github.com/edwardlavender/patter) is an [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package that fits state-space models to animal tracking data using sequential Monte Carlo algorithms (particle filters and smoothers). This wraps the high-performance [`Julia`](https://julialang.org) package [`Patter.jl`](https://github.com/edwardlavender/patter.jl). 

![**`patter` implements particle filtering and smoothing algorithms**. The algorithms reconstruct movements, patterns of space use and residency from animal-tracking data, particularly in acoustic telemetry systems](./fig/particle-maps.png)

# Dependencies

The project was built in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (version `r paste0(version$major, ".", version$minor)`) in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).

# Resources

For `patter` users, these are the most relevant resources: 

1.  **`doc/`** contains workshop documentation:
    
    - **`patter-v.1.0-1/patter-intro.html` is a comprehensive introductory presentation for `patter`**
        - Download this file for a comprehensive introduction to `patter`

2.  **`R/`** contains `R` scripts (workshop exercises):

    -   **`intro-patter.R` is an introductory exercise for `patter`**
        - Download this file for a practical introduction to the basic `patter` workflow

The following directories are relevant for users who clone the project:

1.  **`renv/`** implements local dependency management for `R` packages

2.  **`data/`** contains project management files:
    
    -   `inst/dependencies.rds` is a list of dependencies;
    -   `inst/session-info.rds` is a record of information about the `R` Session;
    -   `inst/tree.rds` is a record of the project directory tree; <br/>
    
3.  **`dev/`** contains project-management scripts

    -   `01-dev.R` records project set up and development;
    -   `02-clone.R` is used to clone the project;
    -   `03-utils.R` contains supporting utilities;

4. **`Julia/`** is the `Julia` project directory. 

5. **`fig/`** contains selected figure(s). 

# Project clones

To clone the project, follow the instructions in `dev/02-clone.R` to install packages and directories:

  - **Packages.** Work through `dev/02-clone.R` to use [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) to regenerate the local project library. Packages can also be manually reinstalled via `02-clone.R`.
  - **Directories.** Rebuild the project directory tree, via `dv::use_template_proj()` and `dv::use_template_tree()`.

Clone the project if you experience issues with package versions on your own machine and you want to work through the introductory `R` script(s).
